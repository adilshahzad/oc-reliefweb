# Octobercms.com plugin for reliefweb
This plugin will help to fetch the information from available APIs from the https://reliefweb.int/
## 7 endpoints
There are seven types of content available through the API, each with a dedicated endpoint. reports, disasters, countries, jobs, training, sources and references.
For this plugin we covered only
##### [Reports](http://reliefweb.int/updates)
##### [Disasters](http://reliefweb.int/disasters)
More you need to look into the [Relief Web documentation](https://apidoc.rwlabs.org/).
Hit me up if you'd like to contribute or extend this plugin.
Thanks,
Adil
